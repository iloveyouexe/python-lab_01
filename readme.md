Lab 1: Data Types and Iterations

Deadline: May 6th, 11:59 PM

Overview
    
    From last week's lecture we talked about data types mainly, with an intro to iterations. The first module will be strictly about data types and structures while the second module will be about iterations and interacting with data types. I highly recommend going ahead and completing module 1 before Wednesday and doing module 2 after lecture this week since we will talk about iterations during that class. This lab you must write your own tests!

Module 1: Data Types
In the file lab_01.py, complete the function extract_from_list. 

III. Module 2: Practice with iteration (Link for iteration in python)
In the file lab_01.py, complete the remaining functions. You may find it helpful to go back and look at the lecture 1 recording to remind about data types. Iteration will become more clear after lecture but if you want to go ahead and get a jump start I recommend doing so
Deliverables:
A screenshot of all the outputs (labeled so I know which function is which) from lab_01.py
Your complete lab_01.py file with proper doc strings each function and test cases (disclaimer: if you donâ€™t write test cases I will consider the function wrong)
